Texera makes it easy to design and execute data analytics workflows visually.  
Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of **example workflows** that highlight Texeraâ€™s capabilities â€” from data ingestion and transformation to visualization and machine learning.

## ðŸ§© Example Workflows

Each example demonstrates how Texera operators can be combined to solve different types of data problems.

- **Text Analytics Workflow**  
  Analyze text data using tokenization, keyword extraction, and word cloud visualization.  
  â†’ See the [Text Analytics Example](https://github.com/Texera/texera/wiki/Example:-Text-Analytics)

- **Join and Filter Workflow**  
  Combine multiple datasets using joins and filters to create complex data pipelines.  
  â†’ See the [Join Operator Example](https://github.com/Texera/texera/wiki/Example:-Join-and-Filter)

- **Machine Learning Workflow**  
  Build end-to-end ML workflows with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation operators.  
  â†’ See the [Machine Learning Example](https://github.com/Texera/texera/wiki/Example:-Machine-Learning)

- **Visualization Workflow**  
  Explore Texeraâ€™s interactive visual operators like scatter plots, histograms, and word clouds.  
  â†’ See the [Visualization Example](https://github.com/Texera/texera/wiki/Example:-Visualization)

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run the Examples

To try these examples on your local Texera instance:

1. Launch Texera following the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide.
2. Open the **Workflow Editor** in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.
3. Import an example workflow file (`.json`) from the [Texera Example Repository](https://github.com/Texera/texera/tree/master/examples).
4. Run the workflow to see Texeraâ€™s operators and data visualizations in action.

## ðŸ§  Want to Contribute an Example?

If youâ€™ve built your own workflow and want to share it:
- Fork the [Texera repository](https://github.com/Texera/texera).
- Add your workflow under `examples/` with a short README.
- Submit a pull request following our [Contribution Guidelines](/docs/contribution-guidelines/).
