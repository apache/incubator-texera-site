## üõ† How to Contribute Code

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the [Texera repository](https://github.com/Texera/texera) on GitHub and clone it locally.

### 2. Find or Open an Issue
- Pick an existing issue or create a new one describing your proposal or bug.
- Discuss your approach with committers before coding to reach consensus.

### 3. Create and Submit a Pull Request
- Develop in a new branch of your fork.
- When ready, submit a PR to the main Texera repository.
- **Allow edits from maintainers** to let committers make small fixes if needed.

#### PR Title and Commit Format
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
- Example PR titles:
  - `feat: add new join operator`
  - `fix(ui): resolve workflow panel crash`
  - `chore(deps): bump dependency versions`
- The PR title becomes the final squashed commit message upon merge.

#### PR Description Should Include:
- **Purpose:** use `Closes #1234` to auto-close an issue.
- **Summary:** short overview of your changes.
- Optional: **design document**, **technical diagram**, or **screenshots**.

Avoid including:
- Local config files (e.g., `python_udf.conf`)
- Secrets or credentials
- Binary or build artifacts

## üß™ Testing and Quality Checks

### Backend (Scala)
1. Run lint:
   ```bash
   sbt "scalafixAll --check"
   ```
   Fix with:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafixAll
   ```
2. Run formatter:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafmtCheckAll
   ```
   Fix with:
   ```bash
   sbt scalafmtAll
   ```
3. Execute tests:
   ```bash
   cd core
   sbt test
   ```

> For IntelliJ users: ensure the working directory matches the module (`amber` for engine tests, `core` for services).

### Frontend (Angular)
1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   cd core/gui
   ng test --watch=false
   ```
2. Format code:
   ```bash
   yarn format:fix
   ```

Write `.spec.ts` tests for new functionality to ensure future safety.

## üîç Pull Request Review Process
1. Request a committer to review your PR.
2. Add labels (e.g., `fix`, `enhancement`, `docs`).
3. Wait for CI to pass ([GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Texera/texera/actions)).
4. Mark your PR as **draft** if it‚Äôs not ready.
5. Once approved, a committer will merge your PR.

---

## üìù Apache License Header
All new files must include the Apache License header.  
To automate this in IntelliJ:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Editor ‚Üí Copyright ‚Üí Copyright Profiles**.  
2. Create a profile named **Apache** and add:
   ```
   Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one
   or more contributor license agreements. See the NOTICE file
   distributed with this work for additional information
   regarding copyright ownership...
   ```
3. Set this as the default profile for the project.
