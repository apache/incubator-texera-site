## 2. Technical Updates

### Infrastructure and Dependencies
- **Switch to Apache Pekko:**
  - The project is replacing Akka with Apache Pekko (Issue #4009, #3237).
  - **Reasoning:** Akka utilizes a non-FOSS Business Software License, preventing the uptake of bug and security fixes; Pekko is Apache-licensed.
- **CI/CD Improvements:**
  - GitHub Actions have been added to Docker images (Issue #4055) to support automatic pushing.
- **Big Object Support:**
  - Implementation of "Supporting Big Objects" (Issue #4067) is underway.
  - The architecture involves Workflow Service Instances, Computing Units, and integration with MinIO and Iceberg for storage and lifecycle management.

### Security
- **Policy Documentation:** A `SECURITY.md` file has been added to the repository outlining the security policy.
- **Security Model Overview:**
  1.  **Authentication:** JWT-based token authentication with configurable expiration.
  2.  **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) with four user roles.
  3.  **Resource Access Control:** Fine-grained privileges for datasets, workflows, and computing units.
  4.  **Deployment Isolation:** Separate security considerations for different deployment modes.
