## 2. Incubation Graduation Requirements and Status

### TODO 1: Software Grant Agreement (SGA)
- **Status:** UCI License office approved releasing the copyright of Texera to PPMC.  
- Chen is finishing up some paperwork; he has requested modifications to the terms and is awaiting a response.  
- Once resolved, the Apache SGA can be submitted quickly.

### TODO 2: Codebase Cleanup
- **Leads:** Xinyuan Lin & Yicong Huang  
- **Progress:**
  - Several major cleanups completed.
  - Two remaining issues:
    1. **Pekko Migration:** PJ suggests moving from Akka to Pekko; PPMC agrees. Will vote on emailing list.
    2. **License Issue with Stack Overflow Code:**
       - Current snippet is under Stack Overflow license, which is not Apache-compatible.
       - **Proposed solution:**
         - Create a GitHub issue referencing the snippet and document its origin.
         - Rewrite the logic to ensure compliance. **Cezar’s Comment:** Rewriting after understanding is acceptable and preferred.

### TODO 3: Donate Codebase to Apache GitHub
- **Action Item:** Prepare the current codebase and initiate the transfer process.

### TODO 4: Apache Website Setup
- **Discussion on Website Hosting Strategy:**
  - **Options:**
    1. Transfer `texera.io` domain to `texera.apache.org`
    2. Redirect `texera.apache.org` to `texera.io` (feasibility under discussion)
    3. [recommended] Maintain both domains separately for different purposes:
       - `texera.apache.org`: Code, documentation, and incubator artifacts  
       - `texera.io`: Academic materials, publications, and grant-related content  
  - **Example Cited:** AsterixDB has separate Apache and academic websites.  
  - **Cezar’s Recommendation:** Ensure anything not officially under Apache IP is hosted outside `apache.org`.

### TODO 5: Documentation
- **Ongoing:** Need to consolidate user guides, developer setup, and governance policies in Apache-compliant format.

### TODO 6: Community Growth Initiatives
- **Academic Collaborations:**
  - University of Michigan, NIH, UCLA, Cornell
- **Public Access Promotion:**
  - Make [hub.texera.io](https://hub.texera.io) public
  - Make [texera.dknet-ai.org](https://texera.dknet-ai.org) public
- **Community Programs:**
  - Integration with [DS4ALL summer program](https://ds4all.ics.uci.edu/ds4all2025/) for data science education using Texera
