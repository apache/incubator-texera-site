Understanding Texera conceptually helps both **users** and **contributors** get the most out of the system.

For end users, it provides background on how workflows and operators interact to process data.  
For contributors, it offers insight into the design principles and architecture that power Texera’s engine and user interface.

### What’s in this section

The **Concepts** section introduces the core ideas that define Texera’s design and operation:

- **Workflows:** How users visually build and manage data pipelines.
- **Operators:** The modular units that perform data transformations.
- **Execution Engine:** The core component that executes workflows efficiently.
- **Data Model:** How Texera represents, stores, and streams data.
- **Architecture:** The high-level structure connecting frontend, backend, and execution layers.

Each page below explores one of these areas in more depth, explaining how Texera’s internal components work together to support flexible, scalable, and interactive data analytics.
